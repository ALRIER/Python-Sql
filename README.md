# Python-Sql

In this repository there are different files in which various web applications have been created. Some of them use geolocation to find addresses; others use python to populate tables in SQL and some others mix both types of parameters.

Please detail all files.

Unfortunately I lost access to the central server so most of the documents do not provide a connection, however the code serves as a great example to follow.

I hope you like it!
